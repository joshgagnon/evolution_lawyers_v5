        <p><em className="heading">These Terms</em></p>
        <p>These are the terms of engagement of Evolution Lawyers Limited (<strong>Evolution Lawyers</strong>, <strong>we</strong>,
            or <strong>us</strong>).&nbsp; We are an incorporated law firm under the Lawyers and Conveyancers Act 2006 <strong>(Act)</strong>.</p>
        <p>These terms are the standard terms on which we provide legal and
            related services to our clients.</p>
        <p>Unless, and only to the extent that, we agree in writing otherwise, these terms will apply to any work we do
            for you.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
            After receiving these terms, your instructions for us to act in any
            given matter will be treated as acceptance of these terms.&nbsp;While we may ask you to
            indicate your acceptance by countersigning a letter of engagement, failure to obtain such a
            signature will not affect the applicability of any provision of these terms except the section
            headed “Guarantee”.&nbsp;Your instructions for us to act, with or without a signature, will
            be sufficient for these terms to apply.
            &nbsp;

        </p>
        <p>
            We may change these terms from time to time.&nbsp;If we change

            <em className="heading">Rules of Conduct and Client Care</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            Evolution Lawyers, its directors, and its employed solicitors must
            comply with the Lawyers and Conveyancers Act (Lawyers: Conduct and Client Care) Rules 2008 (

            <strong>Rules</strong>
            ).
            &nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
            The Rules, which are made under the Act, describe the obligations
            that lawyers have to their clients.&nbsp;Those obligations are subject to overriding duties,
            including to the Court and justice system.
            &nbsp;

        </p>
        <p>
            If you have any questions about the Rules or the obligations of
            lawyers, please contact us or, alternatively, visit www.lawyers.org.nz

            or call the New Zealand Law Society on
            0800 261 801.

        <p>
            <em className="heading">Letter of Engagement</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            We will send you a letter of engagement before commencing work on
            any specific matter.
            &nbsp;

        </p>
        <p>
            The letter of engagement will set out the name of the director of
            Evolution Lawyers with overall responsibility for your matter.&nbsp;It will also provide a
            brief description of the services we will provide in your matter.

        </p>
        <p>
            Our obligations as lawyers are owed, and these terms are applicable,
            to the person(s) named as our client(s) in the letter of engagement.

        </p>
        <p>
            If a client is added or replaced during a matter, whether as
            recorded in writing or as necessary to complete your instructions, our obligations will also be
            owed, and these terms will be applicable to, that added or replaced client.

        </p>
        <p>
            When referring to “you” or “your” in these terms, we are referring
            to the clients named in our letter of engagement, as well as clients added or replaced in the
            manner described above.

        </p>
        <p>
            Unless we agree otherwise, our obligations will not extend to any
            other person.&nbsp;This includes, for example, parents, children, or other family members,
            and shareholders or directors of companies.

            <em className="heading">Our Role</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            We will represent and advise you on all legal matters that we
            consider to be necessary, reasonable, and in accordance with your instructions.&nbsp;In doing
            so, we rely on you to provide instructions, information, and documents that are relevant,
            accurate, complete, and delivered in a manner that is timely and convenient.

        </p>
        <p>
            If any task is not contemplated by, or reasonably required to
            fulfil, your instructions, please do not assume our role will extend to completing that task.
            &nbsp;If you have doubt about whether a particular task falls within the scope of our role,
            please contact us to confirm.
            &nbsp;

        </p>
        <p>
            Unless we agree otherwise, our services will not include providing
            advice or other services related to taxation, commercial, or financial matters.

        </p>
        <p>
            We are qualified to advise on New Zealand law.&nbsp;If we assist
            you in respect of matters governed by foreign law, we do so on the basis that we do not accept
            any responsibility for your legal position under that foreign law.

        </p>
        <p>
            When your instructions on any given matter are completed, our
            representation for you in that matter will end.
            &nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
            We will only provide advice about issues arising after your matter
            is complete, including advice about post-transaction compliance requirements and changes to
            relevant law, if that advice is within the scope of your instructions.

        </p>
        <p>
            <em className="heading">Instructions and Communication</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            We act on the instructions you provide.&nbsp;If you do not
            instruct us to complete a task, and the task is not contemplated in our letter of engagement or
            these terms, expected as part of our normal role as lawyers in the matter, or so obvious that it
            goes without saying, the task may not be completed.

        </p>
        <p>
            We are entitled to act on your instructions even if they are
            contrary to our advice or could result in an outcome that, in our view, would not be in your
            best interests.
            &nbsp;

        </p>
        <p>
            Your instructions may be given to us, and we in turn may communicate
            with you, via any communication method that you use voluntarily or authorise the use of, whether
            expressly or by conduct, to provide us with instructions, information, or documents.&nbsp;
            This includes (without limitation) in person, post, courier, email, facsimile, telephone, and
            electronic messaging services such as WhatsApp.
            &nbsp;

            <em className="heading">Dealing with an Agent</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            If you expressly or impliedly (for example, by conduct) authorise
            another person (<strong>Agent</strong>) to deal with us in connection with your matter, including
            receiving instructions from, or providing information, documents, or advice to, the Agent, we
            may continue to deal with the Agent in connection with the matter instead of dealing directly
            with you, provided such dealing is:

        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>consistent with what we consider would be reasonably expected to be within the Agent’s authority;</li>
            <li>consistent with your instructions;</li>
            <li>consistent with your best interests; and</li>
            <li>reasonably required to complete your instructions.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            An Agent will be presumed to have authority to deal with us until
            the authority is expressly revoked.

        </p>
        <p>
            Any communication with your Agent will be deemed to be communication
            with you.

        </p>
        <p>
            <em className="heading">Use of Our Advice</em>

        <p>
            Our advice is given in your interests and solely for your benefit.

        <p>Our advice is given in your interests and solely for your benefit.&nbsp; No other person may rely on our
            advice.

        <p>Our name, advice, services, and opinions may not be used in, or in connection with, any offering document,

        <p>
            <em className="heading">Standard of Work</em>
        </p>
        <p>When providing legal services to you, we will:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>act competently, in a timely way, and in accordance with instructions received and arrangements made;
            </li>

            <li>protect and promote your interests, and act for you free from compromising influences or loyalties;</li>

            <li>discuss with you your objectives and how they should best be achieved;</li>

            <li>provide you with information about the work to be done, who will do it, and the way the services will be
                provided;
            </li>

            <li>charge you a fee that is fair and reasonable, and let you know how and when you will be billed;</li>

            <li>give you clear information and advice;</li>

            <li>protect your privacy and ensure appropriate confidentiality;</li>


            <li>keep you informed about the work being done, and advise you when it is completed; and</li>

            <li>let you know how to make a complaint, and deal with any complaint promptly and fairly.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            <em className="heading">Our Fees</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            The Rules prevent us from charging you more than a fee that is
            reasonable for the services provided.
            &nbsp;

        </p>
        <p>
            The factors to be considered when determining if a fee is reasonable
            include:

        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>the time and labour expended;</li>

            <li>the skill, specialised knowledge, and responsibility required to perform the services properly;</li>

            <li>the importance of the matter to you and the results achieved;</li>

            <li>the urgency and circumstances in which the matter is undertaken and any time limitations imposed,
                including those you impose;
            </li>

            <li>the degree of risk we assume in undertaking the services, including the amount or value of any property
                involved;
            </li>

            <li>the complexity of the matter and the difficulty or novelty of the questions involved;</li>

            <li>our experience, reputation, and ability;</li>

            <li>the possibility that the acceptance of the particular retainer will preclude us being engaged by other
                clients;
            </li>

            <li>whether the fee is fixed or conditional (whether in litigation or otherwise);</li>

            <li>any quote or estimate of fees we provide;</li>
            <li>any fee agreement (including a conditional fee agreement) we enter into with you;</li>

            <li>the reasonable costs of running a practice; and</li>

            <li>the fee customarily charged in the market and locality for similar legal services.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            We will take factors such as these into account when determining our
            fee.&nbsp;Generally, unless we have agreed a fixed fee, our fees will be calculated on an
            hourly basis.
            &nbsp;

        </p>
        <p>
            <em className="heading">Hourly Rates</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            Our hourly rates are staggered, based on the type of services being
            provided but not the person providing the services.
            &nbsp;

        </p>
        <p>
            The rates are divided into three categories, with the hourly rates
            for each category reflecting the overall level of skill and expertise required for the service
            being provided.
            &nbsp;

        </p>
        <p>
            Examples of the types of services in each category are set out in
            the following table.

            <li>Cancel any discount on fees that we have granted, provided the discount relates to an outstanding amount
                owed to us, or any discount that we have agreed to grant in the future.&nbsp; After cancelling a granted
                discount, we may then issue a new invoice for the discounted fee amount plus GST.
            </li>
            <li>Charge interest on the outstanding amount at the rate of 15% per annum, calculated daily based on a year
                of 365 days, from the due date until the date of actual payment.
            </li>

            <li>Charge you for the fees, expenses, and disbursements we incur in attempting to recover your outstanding
                indebtedness, including legal fees on a solicitor-client basis.&nbsp; If we act for ourselves, we will
                be entitled to costs in an amount equal to the time incurred by us in the matter multiplied by the
                relevant hourly rate set out above, plus the expenses and disbursements set out in these
                terms.&nbsp; Our time will be calculated as if we were acting for a client of the firm in the proceeding
                and otherwise in accordance with these terms.
            </li>
            <li>Suspend or cease acting for you.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            It is your responsibility to pay our invoices when due.&nbsp;If
            we are acting for more than one person in a matter, each client, and all of them together, will
            be responsible for paying our invoices.&nbsp;It does not matter if you expect another person
            to reimburse you or pay the fee on your behalf.
            &nbsp;

        </p>
        <p>
            Your responsibility to pay our invoice will not be affected by our
            invoice being addressed to another person.

            <em className="heading">Estimates and Fixed Fees</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            We will provide a fee estimate for a matter upon request.&nbsp;
            Any fee estimate will be indicative based on the information you provide and the assumptions we
            are reasonably able to make.&nbsp;No estimate we provide will be treated as a quote or
            maximum fee unless specifically stated to be a “fixed fee” in the letter of engagement.
            &nbsp;

        </p>
        <p>
            To the extent we provide a fixed fee in our letter of engagement,
            the fee will only extend to the services described in that letter.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you ask us, we will keep you updated if we believe the fee
            estimate needs to be adjusted or will be exceeded.
            &nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
            If we have provided a fixed fee for any service, we will advise you
            if we believe additional attendances are required.&nbsp;Those additional attendances will not
            be included in the fixed fee.
            &nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
            Any estimate or fixed fee will be subject to the following
            assumptions:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your instructions are accurate and complete.</li>
            <li>The estimate or fixed fee is based on the minimum attendances that we anticipate will be required to
                complete the matter.
            </li>

            <li>The matter will proceed to completion in the manner anticipated by your instructions and within any
                indicated, or a normal, timeframe.
            </li>

            <li>You will provide any required information, documents, or instructions in a timely and efficient
                manner.
            </li>

            <li>No unforeseen impediments will arise.</li>

            <li>All parties and their advisers involved in the matter will be co-operative and reasonable.</li>

            <li>Any third party or regulatory consents or approvals will be given in a timely manner.</li>

            <li>All persons involved in the matter, including individuals, companies, institutions, and organisations,
                as well as their advisers and agents, will be co-operative and reasonable.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            All estimates and fixed fees will include our fee only, and will
            exclude GST and any anticipated disbursements, unless stated otherwise.

        </p>
        <p>
            <em className="heading">Conveyancing Fee Estimates</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition to the assumptions noted above, when we give a fee
            estimate for a conveyancing matter our fee estimate:
        </p>
        <ul>

            <li>will not consider the particular facts and circumstances of your transaction.&nbsp; It is our standard
                fee estimate for the type of transaction that you wish to complete;
            </li>
            <li>will not cover any changes to parties (for example, nominated purchasers), documents (for example,
                variations), dates (for example, condition and settlement dates), or other requirements for the
                transaction;
            </li>
            <li>assumes simple loan documentation from the lender (if any), with no unexpected, unusual, or onerous
                lender requirements or conditions;
            </li>
            <li>assumes there will be one meeting (either in person or via a video conferencing service) during which
                every document required for the transaction will be fully executed; and
            </li>
            <li>will likely be exceeded if you are a first home buyer.&nbsp; Not only do first home buyers usually have
                additional financing requirements, for example KiwiSaver withdrawals and Home Start grants, but also
                have more questions and a greater need for advice than those who have bought a house before.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            <em className="heading">Disbursements and Expenses</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition to our fee, we will charge you for the disbursements and
            expenses we incur in providing services to you.&nbsp;GST is payable on disbursements and
            expenses.

        </p>
        <p>
            Disbursements, including travel and accommodation costs,
            registration and filing costs, court charges, software costs, and the fees of any agents,
            experts, and other professionals, will be charged at the amount charged to us.
            &nbsp;

        </p>
        <p>
            If we use software for your matter and the fees for the software are
            charged in a way that allows us to allocate fees to individual matters, such software fees will
            be on charged to you as a disbursement.&nbsp;This includes (without limitation) some of the
            fees charged for our use of Landonline, ADLS Webforms, the Companies Office website, and CataLex
            Sign.
            &nbsp;

        </p>
        <p>
            It will be up to us to determine if any disbursement is necessary
            for your matter.&nbsp;We will not require your separate authorisation to incur disbursements
            if we believe they are reasonable and necessary to fulfil your instructions.

        </p>
        <p>
            An internal office administration fee of $50 will be charged on
            every invoice we issue to you.&nbsp;This fee covers office and other administration costs
            that we incur when providing our services to you, including postage (except urgent couriers),
            photocopying, faxes, and toll calls.

        </p>
        <p>
            We also charge a $25 file storage fee.&nbsp;This fee covers the
            storage and retention of your documents as required by law.
            &nbsp;

        </p>
        <p>
            A disbursement fee equal to 1.95% of the transaction value may be
            charged on all credit or debit card payments of $1,000 or more.&nbsp;We may, at our
            discretion, invoice you separately for this fee after paying any invoice by credit or debit
            card.
            &nbsp;

        </p>
        <p>
            If we are required to travel more than 10 kilometres to meet you, we
            may charge a mileage disbursement.&nbsp;Mileage is charged at the rate of $0.79 per
            kilometre.

        </p>
        <p>
            Finally, if we need to complete customer due diligence on you in
            accordance with the Anti-Money Laundering and Countering Financing of Terrorism Act 2009 (
            <strong>AMLCFT Act</strong>
            ), or on any other person in connection with your matter, we will
            charge a one-off disbursement fee of $30 for every person on whom we need to complete customer
            due diligence.
            &nbsp;

        </p>
        <p>
            <em className="heading">Trust Account</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            We may ask you to pay us an amount that needs to be paid to a third
            party on your behalf, or that we need to take as security for, or in advance of, our costs.
            &nbsp;We will hold any such amount in our trust account.

        </p>
        <p>
            We will not make any deduction from the funds we hold for you in our
            trust account without your authority, unless the deduction is a payment to you, a transfer to an
            interest-bearing deposit account, or is in payment of one or more of our invoices.
            &nbsp;

        </p>
        <p>
            We will send you a statement showing how funds held in trust have
            been applied regularly (at least every 12 months) and at the end of each matter.

        </p>
        <p>
            We will not accept any payment from you or any other person, nor pay
            any amount on your behalf or on behalf of any other person, in cash, bearer instruments,
            cryptocurrency, or other money or instruments that are the equivalent of cash.&nbsp;Any such
            money or instruments must be converted into New Zealand currency (if necessary), deposited into
            a New Zealand bank account owned and operated by you or on your behalf, and subsequently
            transferred to our trust account by electronic funds transfer, to be used in your matter.
            &nbsp;

        </p>
        <p>
            If we hold funds on interest-bearing deposit in our trust account on
            your behalf, we may charge and deduct an administration fee.&nbsp;That fee will be 5% of the
            gross interest earned while these funds are in our trust account.

        </p>
        <p>
            <em className="heading">Reporting Obligations</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            We may be required to report certain information about you under the
            Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (US) (

            <strong>FATCA</strong>
            ) and the OECD’s Common Reporting Standard (
            <strong>CRS</strong>
            ).&nbsp;You consent to us providing information required by law
            to meet FATCA, CRS, and any other reporting obligation that we may have.

        </p>
        <p>
            We are a reporting entity for the purposes of the AMLCFT Act.
            &nbsp;You acknowledge that, under and to the extent required by that Act, we may be required
            to complete simplified, standard, or enhanced customer due diligence on you before or after
            establishing a business relationship.&nbsp;Our other obligations under the Act include having
            to report suspicious activity.

            <em className="heading">Effective Matter Management</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            To assist the efficient management of your matter, please provide us
            with:

        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>clear instructions, preferably in writing and by email;</li>

            <li>your expectations, including the desired outcome of the work we complete;</li>

            <li>all information including correspondence relevant to the matter;</li>

            <li>important time constraints and deadlines for completing the work;</li>

            <li>the name(s) of anyone else who has authority to give instructions on your behalf; and</li>

            <li>your current contact details.</li>

            <em className="heading">Conflicts of Interest</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            A conflict of interest may arise during us acting for you.&nbsp;
            We will contact you immediately upon becoming aware of a potential conflict of interest.

        </p>
        <p>
            In the event of a conflict of interest, we may need to cease working

            <em className="heading">Costs of Litigation</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            If your matter involves litigation of any form, we recommend that
            you consider the following:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>If the Court grants an award of costs in your favour, the amount of the award will most likely be less
                than fees, expenses, and disbursements due under these terms of engagement. Unless you have a
                contractual entitlement, only in rare cases, such as a serious abuse of process, will the Court be
                prepared to award full recovery of your actual legal costs.
            </li>

            <li>If you are unsuccessful in any Court procedure, the Court may make a costs award against you. Your legal
                requirement to pay any costs award will not affect your liability under these terms.
            </li>
        </ul>

            <em className="heading">Governing Law</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            These terms of engagement and any other agreement we have with you

            Zealand courts.

        </p>
        <p>
            <em className="heading">Guarantee</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            This section applies if, and to the extent that:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li> our client for a matter is a company; and</li>

            <li>an individual (
                <strong>Guarantor</strong>
                ) has signed a letter of engagement or other document
                confirming that he or she personally guarantees the company’s obligations to us.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            The Guarantor provides a continuing, all-obligations, and personal
            guarantee of the payment of all amounts the client owes to us under these terms from time to
            time, including amounts owed under invoices issued by us, for interest, and for costs.&nbsp;
            If the client defaults to pay any such amount when due, we may, on written demand, require the
            Guarantor to pay the amount.&nbsp;The Guarantor’s liability under this clause will not be
            discharged, including for anything that could discharge the liability but for this clause, until
            we provide written confirmation of such discharge.
